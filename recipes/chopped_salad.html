    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to chopped salads every ingredient is cut small and about the same size. The beauty of this dish is you get a taste of every ingredient in every single bite.

        If you turn a classic chicken Caesar into a chopped Caesar, for example, youâ€™ll get lettuce, crouton, cheese, and chicken in every forkful rather than just a single leaf of Romaine draped in dressing.

    <h2>Who Invented the Chopped Salad?</h2>
    <p>
        As far as I can gather, the concept of chopped salads sprung from the Hollywood scene.

        Some say the trend started in the 70s at a Beverly Hills restaurant called La Scala, but if you consider the Cobb, the original chopped salad, that was invented in the 1930s at the Brown Derby restaurant in Los Angeles.

        Since then, entire restaurant chains have been built around the chopped salad. You can find every possible iteration, right down to this scrumptious Tex-Mex version.
